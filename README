DESCRIPTION

    Acme::Buckaroo - Buckaroo Banzai Characters Infest Your Code!


    The first time you run this program, the entire text of the program
    after the 'use Acme::Buckaroo;' is converted (character by character)
    into characters from the movie "Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eigth
    Dimension" (and some other phrases, too).

    The program will work (or not!) exactly as it did before it was
    converted, but the code will be a somewhat endearing tribute to a
    movie, instead of a clean, complete, clearly commented set of lines
    of Perl code.

    if you want to convert your program BACK into Perl, you must edit the
    Acme::Buckaroo.pm module and turn on debugging (change the
    line, "my $debugmode = 0;" to the line, "my $debugmode = 1;" and then
    run the script again.  As it executes, it will translate the program
    back.  Capture the output of this and you have your program back.

    Acme::Buckaroo came about because the modules Acme::Buffy, Acme::Morse,
    Acme::Pony, and Acme::Bleach were somewhat cryptically written.  This
    author believes that CODE SHOULD BE SIMPLE and CLEAR to read and
    understand.  Code that isn't clear is far less value.  And, since these
    modules are for learning or FUN anyway, I might as well start here.

    As someone who has taught beginners to use Perl, I've seen the problems
    caused by using Perl idioms where typing a few more characters can make
    maintenance possible and even quite easy.


SYNOPSIS

    Before Buckaroo-ing:

        use Acme::Buckaroo;
        print "Watch 'Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' Today!";

    After Bucaroo-ing:

        use Acme::Buckaroo;

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

DEPENDENCIES

    This module requires NO other modules or libraries.
    If you go into the source of Buckaroo.pm and look, you'll see
    there is a debug mode.  If you turn this on, you'll be able to
    watch it as it works.  However, debug mode requires the module
    Data::Dumper, a fantastically useful module that you should
    have by default in Perl installations > 5.6.


DEDICATION

    I'd like to dedicate this module to Mr. Damian Conway, who has bettered
    Perl and the lives of those in the Perl-using community by vast amounts,
    and continues to do good work.  Someday I'd like to buy him a beer.

    The book, by the way, is "Object Oriented Perl", by Damian Conway
    and Randall L. Schwartz, published by Manning Publications Company;
    ISBN: 1884777791; (August 1999).

    Also thanks to Jesse who reported a bug in this documentation
    and introduced me to the CPAN bug tracking database, available
    to everyone to report bugs in CPAN modules or scripts.  The address
    for this is http://rt.cpan.org. If you know of a bug in a CPAN module,
    report it there!

EXPORT

    None by default.

SEE ALSO

    Acme::Buffy, Acme::Morse, Acme::Pony, Acme::Bleach, and L<perl>.

DIAGNOSTICS

    Cannot Buckaroo '%s'

        Acme::Buckaroo could not modify the source file.
        Are the file permissions set?

    Cannot Buckaroo again on '%s'

        Acme::Buckaroo couldn't read the source file for
        whatever reason. Ooops.
